Subject: Urgent: Client Complaint Follow-up

Team,

I'm writing to bring to your attention a serious complaint we received this morning from our premium client, TechGlobal Inc. 

The issues raised are concerning:
1. Their last invoice contained several billing errors totaling approximately $12,000
2. The support team took 72 hours to respond to their critical outage ticket
3. The account manager has been unresponsive for over a week

This is completely unacceptable for a client of this caliber. They're threatening to terminate their $2M annual contract if we don't:
- Immediately correct the invoice errors
- Provide a 15% discount on this quarter's invoice
- Assign a new account manager
- Implement a SLA with guaranteed response times

Action items:
1. Finance team: Audit and correct the invoice by EOD today
2. Support lead: Review the ticket response process and implement improvements
3. Sales director: Personally reach out to the client by 3PM today
4. HR: Meet with the current account manager to understand the situation

I want a full report on corrective actions by tomorrow at 10AM. Let's not lose this important client due to preventable mistakes.

Regards,
Sarah Johnson
Customer Success Director
